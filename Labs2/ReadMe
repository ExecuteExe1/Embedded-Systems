#Real-Time Number Analysis System
  A real-time embedded system that analyzes numeric input digits with LED feedback and interrupt handling capabilities.

##System Overview
 This system processes multi-digit numbers in real-time, providing visual feedback through an LED and handling user interrupts via button presses with UART communication.

##Features
 ### 1.Number Input
  -Accepts multi-digit numbers (e.g., 52719)
  -Each digit is processed sequentially

 ### 2.Digit Analysis
  -Processing Time: 0.5 seconds per digit
  -Even Digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8):
   *LED blinks with 200ms ON / 200ms OFF pattern
   *Total cycle = 400ms (within the 0.5s processing window)
  -Odd Digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9):
   *LED toggles state (ON ↔ OFF)
   *Single state change per digit

### 3.First Button Press (Freeze Mode)
 1. LED Freeze:
   - Current LED state is locked
   - No further LED changes occur

2. UART Output:
   "Button pressed. Led locked. Count=x"
   Where x = total button presses since system start

3. Analysis Continues:
   - Digit analysis proceeds normally
   - All processing logged via UART
   - LED remains static

4. Priority System:
   UART vs Button → Button has HIGHER priority

### 3.2Second Button Press (Exit Freeze)
  - Returns to normal operation
  - LED resumes responding to digit analysis
  - System continues with current number analysis

### 4.New Number Input
-Completion-Based Input
  *After full number analysis: "Analysis complete. Enter new number:"
  *System waits for new numeric input

-Interrupt-Based Input 
USER CAN INPUT NEW NUMBER AT ANY TIME:

1. Immediate Response:
   - Current analysis STOPS immediately
   - No completion of current digit

2. Clean Restart:
   - New analysis begins from first digit
   - LED resets to initial state
   - Button press count persists

3. Priority:
   New Number Input > Current Analysis

### 5.System Architecture

[Start] → [Wait for Number] → [Process Digit 1] → [Process Digit 2] → ...

      │         │              [Button Press?]
      │         │                    ↓
      │    [New Number]     [Freeze LED, Log Count]
      │         │                    ↓

                │                    ↓
                └───────[Second Press → Resume]

### 6.State Management
- Normal State: LED responds to digit parity
- Frozen State: LED static, UART active
- Input State: Accepting new numeric input

### 7.Implementation Details
 - Timing Control
   *Digit processing: 500ms fixed duration
   *LED blink: 200ms ON, 200ms OFF (even digits)
   *LED toggle: Instantaneous (odd digits)

- Interrupt Handling
  *Button press triggers immediate interrupt
  *Non-blocking UART communication
  *State preservation during freeze mode

### 8.UART Communication
System Start: "Enter a number:"
Even Digit:   "Digit X: Even - Blinking LED"
Odd Digit:    "Digit X: Odd - Toggling LED"
Button Press: "Button pressed. Led locked. Count=x"
New Input:    "New number detected. Starting analysis..."
Complete:     "Analysis complete. Enter new number:"
